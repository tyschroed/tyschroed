### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tyler

I'm a developer who loves to turn vague ideas into concrete applications that delight. These days I spend most of my time building and managing **awesome engineering teams** that build **incredible products** and **have fun** doing it.

If I'm not writing code, I'm trying to keep up with my two boys, pretending to be a woodworker in my shop, or playing in the :sunrise_over_mountains:.
